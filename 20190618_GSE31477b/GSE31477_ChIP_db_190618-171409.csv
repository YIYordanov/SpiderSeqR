Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described for this gene but the full-length nature for some of them is unknown (RefSeq). || antibody vendorname: Santa Cruz Biotech || antibody vendorid: sc-197 || control: IgG-rab || control description: Input signal from Normal Rabbit IgG ChIP-seq. || control: IgG-rab || control description: Input signal from Normal Rabbit IgG ChIP-seq. || controlid: wgEncodeEH002819 || replicate: 1";"A549 -;- epithelial cell line derived from a lung carcinoma tissue.

The HA.11 antibody recognizes the influenza hemagglutinin epitope (YPYDVPDYA) which has been used extensively as a general epitope tag in expression vectors. The extreme specificity of the antibody allows unambiguous identification and quantitative analysis of the tagged protein. The HA.11 antibody recognizes HA epitopes located in the middle of protein sequences as well as at the N- or C-terminus. Antibody Target: HA-E2F1 || antibody targetdescription: The HA-E2F1 protein is a derivative of E2F1, a member of the E2F family of transcription factors. The E2F family plays a crucial role in the control of cell cycle and action of tumor suppressor proteins and is also a target of the transforming proteins of small DNA tumor viruses. The E2F proteins contain several evolutionary conserved domains found in most members of the family. These domains include a DNA binding domain, a dimerization domain which determines interaction with the differentiation regulated transcription factor proteins (DP), a transactivation domain enriched in acidic amino acids, and a tumor suppressor protein association domain which is embedded within the transactivation domain.

Antibody Target: HA-E2F1 || antibody targetdescription: The HA-E2F1 protein is a derivative of E2F1, a member of the E2F family of transcription factors. The E2F family plays a crucial role in the control of cell cycle and action of tumor suppressor proteins and is also a target of the transforming proteins of small DNA tumor viruses. The E2F proteins contain several evolutionary conserved domains found in most members of the family. These domains include a DNA binding domain, a dimerization domain which determines interaction with the differentiation regulated transcription factor proteins (DP), a transactivation domain enriched in acidic amino acids, and a tumor suppressor protein association domain which is embedded within the transactivation domain.

Many E2F proteins contain several evolutionarily conserved domains: a DNA binding domain, a dimerization domain which determines interaction with the differentiation regulated transcription factor proteins (DP), a transactivation domain enriched in acidic amino acids, and a tumor suppressor protein association domain which is embedded within the transactivation domain. The encoded protein of this gene is atypical because it lacks the transactivation and tumor suppressor protein association domains. It contains a modular suppression domain and is an inhibitor of E2F-dependent transcription. The protein is part of a multimeric protein complex that contains a histone methyltransferase and the transcription factors Mga and Max. Multiple transcript variants have been reported for this gene, but it has not been clearly demonstrated that they encode valid isoforms (RefSeq). || antibody vendorname: Santa Cruz Biotech || antibody vendorid: sc-22823 || control: std || control description: Standard input signal for most experiments. || control: std || control description: Standard input signal for most experiments. || controlid: wgEncodeEH000612 || labversion: Fragmented using Bioruptor, precipitated with StaphA || replicate: 1 || softwareversion: PeakSeq1.0 (fdr 0.001)";"HeLa-S3 -;- cervical carcinoma -;- ectoderm";"HeLa-S3 -;- cervical carcinoma";"E2F6";"E2F6";NA;NA;"None -;- No special treatment or protocol applies";"None"

E2F family members play a crucial role in control of the cell cycle and of the action of tumor suppressor proteins. They are also a target of the transforming proteins of small DNA tumor viruses. Many E2F proteins contain several evolutionarily conserved domains: a DNA binding domain, a dimerization domain which determines interaction with the differentiation regulated transcription factor proteins (DP), a transactivation domain enriched in acidic amino acids, and a tumor suppressor protein association domain which is embedded within the transactivation domain. The encoded protein of this gene is atypical because it lacks the transactivation and tumor suppressor protein association domains. It contains a modular suppression domain and is an inhibitor of E2F-dependent transcription. The protein is part of a multimeric protein complex that contains a histone methyltransferase and the transcription factors Mga and Max.

This protein links the transcriptional modulation of key metabolic genes to cellular growth and development, and has been implicated in the control of nuclear genes required for respiration, heme biosynthesis and mitochondrialDNA transcription and replication. NRF1 forms a homodimer and binds DNA as a dimer. NRF1 shows a nuclear localization and is expressed widely in embryonic, fetal and adult tissues. Phosphorylation of NRF1 enhances DNA binding. || antibody vendorname: Abcam || antibody vendorid: ab55744 || control: IgG-rab || control description: Input signal from Normal Rabbit IgG ChIP-seq. || control: IgG-rab || control description: Input signal from Normal Rabbit IgG ChIP-seq. || controlid: wgEncodeEH001791 || replicate: 1";"lab: Stanford || lab description: Snyder - Stanford University || datatype: ChipSeq || datatype description: Chromatin IP Sequencing || cell: HepG2 || cell organism: human || cell description: hepatocellular carcinoma || cell karyotype: cancer || cell lineage: endoderm || cell sex: M || treatment: None || treatment description: No special treatment or protocol applies || antibody: Nrf1 || antibody antibodydescription: Mouse monoclonal, Immunogen corresponding to amino acids 201-286 of Human NRF1.
