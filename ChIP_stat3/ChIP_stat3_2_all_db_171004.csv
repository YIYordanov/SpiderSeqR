Depending on context, can bind a histone acetyltransferase (HAT)-containing complex and function as transcriptional activator or bind a histone deacetylase (HDAC)-containing complex and function as transcriptional repressor. Involved in transcriptional regulation by binding to chromatin insulators and preventing interaction between promoter and nearby enhancers and silencers. Preferentially interacts with unmethylated DNA, preventing spreading of CpG methylation. Can dimerize, mediating long-range chromatin looping. When bound to chromatin, provides an anchor point for nucleosomes positioning. Involved in sister chromatid cohesion.

This second-generation HA antibody is an excellent substitute for the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody. The HA.11 antibody recognizes the influenza hemagglutinin epitope (YPYDVPDYA) which has been used extensively as a general epitope tag in expression vectors. The extreme specificity of the antibody allows unambiguous identification and quantitative analysis of the tagged protein. The HA.11 antibody recognizes HA epitopes located in the middle of protein sequences as well as at the N- or C-terminus. Antibody Target: HA-E2F1 || antibody targetdescription: The HA-E2F1 protein is a derivative of E2F1, a member of the E2F family of transcription factors. The E2F family plays a crucial role in the control of cell cycle and action of tumor suppressor proteins and is also a target of the transforming proteins of small DNA tumor viruses. The E2F proteins contain several evolutionary conserved domains found in most members of the family. These domains include a DNA binding domain, a dimerization domain which determines interaction with the differentiation regulated transcription factor proteins (DP), a transactivation domain enriched in acidic amino acids, and a tumor suppressor protein association domain which is embedded within the transactivation domain. This version of E2F1 includes an N terminal HA tag and a modified ER ligand binding domain to allow regulated translocation to the nucleus. || antibody vendorname: Covance || antibody vendorid: MMS-101P || control: UCDavis || control description: Input library was prepared at UC Davis. || control: UCDavis || control description: Input library was prepared at UC Davis. || controlid: wgEncodeEH000762 || labversion: MCF-7 cells stably expressed a tagged HA-E2F1 were fragmented using Bioruptor, precipitated with StaphA and an antibody to the  HA tag, || replicate: 1 || softwareversion: PeakSeq1.0 (fdr 0.001)	lab: USC || lab description: Farnham - University of Southern California || datatype: ChipSeq || datatype description: Chromatin IP Sequencing || cell: MCF-7 || cell organism: human || cell description: mammary gland, adenocarcinoma.

Plays a role in transcription, DNA repair of double-stranded breaks, and recombination. Mutations in this gene are responsible for approximately 40% of inherited breast cancers and more than 80% of inherited breast and ovarian cancers. || antibody vendorname: Bethyl Labratories || antibody vendorid: A300-000A || control: IgG-rab || control description: Input signal from Normal Rabbit IgG ChIP-seq. || control: IgG-rab || control description: Input signal from Normal Rabbit IgG ChIP-seq. || controlid: wgEncodeEH001834 || replicate: 1	H1-hESC -;- embryonic stem cells -;- inner cell mass	NA	BRCA1_(A300-000A)	BRCA1_(A300-000A)	NA	NA	None -;- No special treatment or protocol applies	None

It is able to form homodimers and heterodimers with other family members, which include Mad, Mxi1 and Myc. Myc is an oncoprotein implicated in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The homodimers and heterodimers compete for a common DNA target site (the E box) and rearrangement among these dimer forms provides a complex system of transcriptional regulation. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described for this gene but the full-length nature for some of them is unknown (RefSeq). || antibody vendorname: Santa Cruz Biotech || antibody vendorid: sc-197 || control: std || control description: Standard input signal for most experiments. || control: std || control description: Standard input signal for most experiments. || controlid: wgEncodeEH000780 || labversion: Illumina 2.0, low confidence sequences excluded || replicate: 1	HUVEC -;- umbilical vein endothelial cells -;- mesoderm	NA	Max	Max	NA	NA	None -;- No special treatment or protocol applies	None

E2F family members play a crucial role in control of the cell cycle and of the action of tumor suppressor proteins. They are also a target of the transforming proteins of small DNA tumor viruses. Many E2F proteins contain several evolutionarily conserved domains: a DNA binding domain, a dimerization domain which determines interaction with the differentiation regulated transcription factor proteins (DP), a transactivation domain enriched in acidic amino acids, and a tumor suppressor protein association domain which is embedded within the transactivation domain. The encoded protein of this gene is atypical because it lacks the transactivation and tumor suppressor protein association domains. It contains a modular suppression domain and is an inhibitor of E2F-dependent transcription. The protein is part of a multimeric protein complex that contains a histone methyltransferase and the transcription factors Mga and Max.

This gene also contains long CAG trinucleotide repeats that encode consecutive glutamine residues. The protein appears to bind and regulate the promoters of the extracellular matrix genes MMP1, MMP3, MMP7 and COL1A1. Studies in mouse suggest that nuclear matrix transcription factors (NP/NMP4) may be part of a general mechanical pathway that couples cell construction and function during extracellular matrix remodeling.

Associates with both centromeres and chromosomal arms during metaphase and required for cohesin localization to CTCF sites. || antibody vendorname: Santa Cruz Biotech || antibody vendorid: sc-15914 || control: IgG-rab || control description: Input signal from Normal Rabbit IgG ChIP-seq. || control: IgG-rab || control description: Input signal from Normal Rabbit IgG ChIP-seq. || controlid: wgEncodeEH002819	A549 -;- epithelial cell line derived from a lung carcinoma tissue.
